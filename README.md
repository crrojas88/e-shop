# Rodslist E-Shop

Welcome to [Rodslist](https://app.netlify.com/sites/rodslist/deploys), an e-commerce app built with Next.js and deployed on Netlify!
<br/>

### With Rodslist, a user can:
- Browse through different products
- View product description
- Add items to your cart
- View / hide cart
- Checkout
- Process an order
- Cancel an order
<br/>

# Motivation
I wanted to create a clean and simple e-commerce app that I could eventually use to sell real products once implemented with stripe functionality to process payments.
<br/>

# Stretch Goals
Some of these goals I set for myself to improve the user experience of the app. I will eventually try to implement these changes to make the app more user friendly.
- A user should be able to remove an item from their cart.
- A user should be able to create an account to see their purchase history.
- A user should be able to change the quantity of an item in their cart.
- A user should be redirected to a Stripe page in order to process payment.
<br/>

# Development Setbacks
Like mentioned previously, I would like to be able to build extra functionality to the app. Eventually implementing stripe so users could purchase real items and get charged. Other functionality that I would have liked to implement on the app would have been to be able to remove items from the cart on the cart toggle as well as at checkout. Having the option to change the quantity of each item would also be something that I would like to implement in the future, or for an improved version of this app.

# Rodslist E-Shop

Welcome to [Rodslist](https://app.netlify.com/sites/rodslist/deploys), an e-commerce app built with Next.js!
<br/>

### With Rodslist you can:
- Browse through different products
- View product description
- Add items to your cart
- View / hide cart

<br/>

# Motivation
I wanted to create a clean and simple e-commerce app that I could eventually use to sell real products once hooked up to stripe.
<br/>

# Functionality
This application implements the following concepts used in React, Next.js, and Javascript:
- Client-side routing
- Styled components
- Use and placement of State
- Props
- Destructuring  
<br />
